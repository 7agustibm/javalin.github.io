<h1 class="no-margin-top">A lightweight REST API library</h1>

Javalin is a true micro Java REST API library and has no required external dependencies 
other than the embedded web-server. It has an optional dependency for Jackson,
in order to provide out-of-the-box object mapping support (`response.json(object)`).
To use this feature you need to have Jackson included as a dependency.
